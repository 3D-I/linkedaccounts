# Linked Accounts
Linked Accounts is a new phpBB 3.2 extension that allows your users to link all their owned accounts so they can switch between them without having to type the password every time.

## Requirements
- phpBB 3.2

## Features
- **Account linking**. Link all your owned accounts to easily switch between them without having to type your password
- **Bidirectional links**. A link created from account A to B will automatically allow account B to switch to A.
- **Permission-ready**. Choose which groups can use the account switching features.
- **User selection menu**. Find the username of the account you want to link without having to type it. (Because this extension is about not typing, right?).
- **phpBB integration**. The extension beautifuly behaves as if the linking account system was part of the phpBB core.
